# reshsettingsdiscover
Fork of ReSharper Solution Settings Autodiscovery.

From Serge Baltic: When you open a solution in Visual Studio, this plugin looks for any *.AutoLoad.DotSettings files in parent folders and loads them as ReSharper settings layers. This allows to apply a root settings file to all solutions in the same source control.
